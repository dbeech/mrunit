Release Notes - MRUnit - Version 0.9.0

** Bug
    * [MRUNIT-54] - Driver.runTest throws RuntimeException should it throw AssertionError?
    * [MRUNIT-70] - copy(orig, conf) in Serialization shouldn't require objects to have a no-args constructor, and copy(orig, copy, conf) seems to violate contract for deserializer.deserialize()
    * [MRUNIT-77] - cannot use serializations that do not clone into object, or serializations without no arg constructors with reduce driver
    * [MRUNIT-86] - Configuration not passed to individual mappers/reducers in mapred MapReducerDriver, PipelineMapReduceDriver

** Dependency upgrade
    * [MRUNIT-90] - upgrade junit to 4.10 and change ExpectedSuppliedException to implement TestRule instead 

** Improvement
    * [MRUNIT-45] - MockOutputCollector.deepCopy should use o.a.h.mrunit.Serialization.copy

    * [MRUNIT-65] - return better error message when mapper or reducer is null for MapDriver or ReduceDriver
    * [MRUNIT-66] - null input checks and behavior on no input to a driver are inconsistent
    * [MRUNIT-72] - MRUnit pom.xml should not depend on 0.23.1-SNAPSHOT
    * [MRUNIT-74] - Matching output but at incorrect position is not returned as an Error in the message string thrown in the RuntimeException
    * [MRUNIT-75] - cleanup exception checking in tests to use a @Rule ExpectedException
