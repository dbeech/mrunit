Apache MRUnit Build Instructions

REQUIREMENTS:

- Java 1.6
- Apache Maven 2.2.1 or higher
- Access to the internet

BUILDING:

From the command line:

Building MRUnit is dependent upon the version of Hadoop Map Reduce you intend to use.

Hadoop Map Reduce 1.0.0:
$ mvn package
This produces mrunit-${VERSION}-dist.tar.gz and mrunit-${VERSION}-hadoop100.jar in the target directory.

Hadoop Map Reduce 0.23.1:
$ mvn package -Dhadoop.version=0.23
This produces mrunit-${VERSION}-dist.tar.gz and mrunit-${VERSION}-hadoop023.jar in the target directory.

Hadoop Map Reduce 0.20.2:
$ mvn package -Dhadoop.version=0.20
This produces mrunit-${VERSION}-dist.tar.gz and mrunit-${VERSION}-hadoop020.jar in the target directory.

If you wish you skip the unit tests (not advised):

$ mvn package -DskipTests

You can also clean the project by running:

$ mvn clean

From Eclipse:

1. Install the m2eclipse plugin from http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/
2. Restart Eclipse
3. Select File -> Import... -> Existing Maven Project...
4. After the project has been imported, it may be necessary to right click the
project in the project explorer and select Maven -> Update Project
Configuration. This is also normally necessary if you change a build plugin or
some other element of the build itself. See the m2eclipse docs for details.
